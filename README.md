# Health-Analysis-of-Global-and-Regional-Burdens-2007-2017-
This project analyzes global malaria trends from 2007 to 2017, focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa. It explores links between malaria cases, healthcare access, water and sanitation, and preventive measures. The goal is to uncover key patterns and support data-driven interventions to reduce malaria’s impact.

## INTRODUCTION:
Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in areas with limited access to essential healthcare services. Between 2007 and 2017, **588 million** malaria cases were recorded worldwide, with **Sub-Saharan Africa** experiencing the heaviest burden. This analysis provides an in-depth examination of malaria trends, identifying key contributing factors such as disease prevalence, access to water and sanitation, and the use of preventive measures like insecticide-treated mosquito nets.

The study leverages diverse datasets and advanced analytical techniques to uncover critical insights. By exploring correlations between malaria incidence, healthcare accessibility, and socioeconomic factors, this analysis highlights priority areas for targeted interventions. Additionally, the report examines regional disparities in water, sanitation, and malaria treatments, emphasizing urban-rural inequalities and their impact on disease transmission.

Through data-driven findings, structured observations, and visual representations, this report aims to support policymakers and stakeholders in making informed, evidence-based decisions to reduce malaria’s impact and enhance living conditions in affected communities.

## KEY METRICS:

**Global Malaria Trends (2007–2017):**
* Total malaria cases reported: **588 million.**
* Malaria cases are rising year-over-year, indicating that malaria remains a **persistent global health challenge.**
  
**Top 5 Countries with the Highest Malaria Cases:**
* **Congo:** 7,755,524 cases.
* **Mozambique:** 43,984,158 cases.
* **Burkina Faso:** 41,601,963 cases.
* **Uganda:** 41,126,230 cases.
* **Burundi:** 40,249,714 cases.
  
**Countries with Minimal or Zero Malaria Cases:**
* **Algeria:** 94 cases.
* **Cabo Verde:** 699 cases.
* **Eswatini:** 4,531 cases.
* **Botswana:** 8,756 cases.
**Zero cases:** Egypt, Morocco, Libya.

**Countries with Highest Malaria Prevalence in Children:**
Liberia, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Ghana.

**Use of Treated Mosquito Nets by Children:**
* Rwanda: 405.00.
* Senegal: 335.20.
* Malawi: 270.00.
* Congo DR: 108.00.
* Mozambique: 113.40.
* Burkina Faso: 112.70.
* Uganda: 211.90.

**Access to Water Services:**
* Face significant challenges in access to basic water services and sanitation.
* Regions with high malaria prevalence also report poor water and sanitation services, which may contribute to the spread of malaria.
* Urban areas consistently have better access to water and sanitation services compared to rural areas.

**Children Receiving Malaria Treatment:**
* A higher percentage of sick children in rural areas receive malaria treatment compared to urban areas, indicating rural prioritization despite resource scarcity.
  
## PATTERNS OR ANOMALIES:

**Correlations:**
* Higher malaria cases are observed in regions with limited access to water, sanitation, and treated mosquito nets.
* Rural areas, despite being underserved in sanitation and water services, prioritize malaria treatment in children.
* Countries with significant malaria cases often exhibit lower mosquito net usage.
**Anomalies:**
* Some countries like Rwanda and Senegal achieve high mosquito net coverage despite economic challenges, which suggests targeted public health efforts.
**Trends:**
* Over the decade, malaria incidence has increased despite global efforts.
* Urban-rural disparity in access to water and sanitation services persists, exacerbating health inequities.
  
## Report Document
### Summary of Findings:

**Malaria Prevalence and Trends:**
* Malaria cases have been steadily rising over the years, with Sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected region.
**Access to Water and Sanitation:**
* Rural populations lag significantly behind urban populations in access to basic water and sanitation services.
* This disparity correlates with higher malaria incidence in rural areas.
**Mosquito Net Usage:**
* Countries with high malaria rates report low mosquito net usage, highlighting gaps in public health interventions.
  
## Recommendations:

**Strengthen Public Health Programs:**
* Increase the distribution of treated mosquito nets in high-risk areas.
* Enhance awareness campaigns on malaria prevention.
**Improve Water and Sanitation Access:**
* Invest in rural water infrastructure to bridge the urban-rural gap.
* Implement targeted sanitation programs in malaria-prone regions.
**Encourage Integrated Efforts:**
* Leverage existing healthcare infrastructure to ensure wider coverage of antimalarial drugs and mosquito nets.
**Further Investigations:**
* Explore the impact of education levels and socioeconomic factors on malaria prevention efforts.
* Analyze seasonal patterns in malaria incidence for better resource allocation.
